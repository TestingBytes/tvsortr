tvsortr.rb Version 0.2
Author: Sam Johnson (samuel.johnson@gmail.com)
Date: November 10, 2012

Description: This script takes a folder of downloaded TV shows and moves them into an XBMC friendly directory tree
  
Example: ruby tvsortr.rb --downloads=Downloads --destination=TV
  ../Downloads/American.Dad.S05E03.avi is copied to ../TV/American Dad/American.Dad.S05E03.avi
  
Flags:
  --downloads=s       The path to your downloaded TV shows
  --destination=s     The path to your XBMC TV media Path
  --dryrun            Doesn't actually move anything
  
Notes:
  - Logs are saved to "~/Library/Logs/tvsortr.log"
  - Currently detects only 2 naming conventions:
      Episodic Shows: {Period.delimited.show.name}.S{number}E{number}.*
      Daily Shows:    {Period.delimited.show.name}.{YYYY}.{MM}.{DD}.*

TODO:
  - Add /S\d{2}xE\d{2}/ naming convention for Episodic shows (and look into other XBMC recognized formats)
  - Add rename option to transfer A.TV.Show.S03E21.blah.HDTV.[someCrew].avi to A.TV.Show.S03E21.avi
